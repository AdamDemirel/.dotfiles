**Problem:** getting my logitech k810 keyboard to work/pair with bluetoothctl
Solution:
1. First and foremost (i learnt my lesson of 2 days wasted time before figuring out this solution, install this hcd file [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=204739](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=204739) [https://memcpy.io/fixing-bluetooth-on-the-xps-15-9550-on-ubuntu.html](https://memcpy.io/fixing-bluetooth-on-the-xps-15-9550-on-ubuntu.html) and put it in and simply put it in **/lib/firmware/brcm/BCM-0a5c-6410.hcd** (this will solve the issue of the keyboard not showing up in bluetoothctl), followed by rebooting device
- Install `bluez bluez-utils-compat` (blue-utils has bluetoothctl in it, utils-compat in yaourt)
- Modprobe btusb
- Systemctl restart bluetooth (or systemctl stop bluetooth, systemctl start bluetooth)
- Bluetoothctl
- Power off
- Power on
- agent KeyboardOnly
- default-agent
- Scan on
- Pair 34:88:5D:3C:93:34
- Enter code
- Trust 34:88:5D:3C:93:34

**Problem: laptop battery doesn’t last long**
Solution: `powertop` is a power management program that is installed by default. Run it from cli and tab to the ‘tunables’ tab. Then click enter on all the records that have ‘bad’ set to set them to ‘good’.
